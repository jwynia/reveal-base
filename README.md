# J Wynia's Reveal.js Repo
I use this repo to make it easy for me to make Reveal.js presentations that refer to centralized CSS, templates, etc.

This makes it so I can put a presentation into some other project as a single HTML file instead of all of the framework.

The CSS/JS for Reveal itself are on the GH Pages for this repo.
